# Exploratory Data Analysis in Netflix Data
Netflix is an American over-the-top content platform. Netflix was founded in 1997 by Reed Hastings and Marc Randolph in California. The company's primary business is a subscription-based streaming service offering online streaming from a library of films and television series, including those produced in-house. In January 2021, Netflix reached 203.7 million subscribers, including 73 million in the United States.

In this project, I will examine data about the Netflix I got from kaggle. In our dataset, there are 7787 observations (movies,series and documentaries). We have information about these observations such as type, title, director, cast, country, date added, release date, genre, rating, duration.

- Type :movie or TV Show
- Title: Name
- Listed in : genre
- Country: which country the movie was shot by

We will compare genres, countries, and durations of movies and TV shows in the data set. We'll look at the oldest movies and directors with the most movies on Netflix and more.
